# Published-Date

![Published Date](/img/icons/icon.png)

This Add-on tries to find out when exactly a website or an article on a website was published and last edited.

![Example 1: The Add-on found multiple possible dates with high confidence.](/img/screenshots/1.png)

![Example 2: The Add-on found only one possible date with low confidence, but offers to use WayBackMaschine.](/img/screenshots/2.png)

There is no guarantee, that a web page provides any visible or hidden information about when it was published / last updated!

## How does it work?

"Published Date" uses around 40 different ways to try to find out when the web page you are visiting was published and when it was last edited / updated.
Therefore, there can be multiple possible (and even different) results.

Just visit a website and click on the Add-on icon!

## Install
